# Project Notify
A notification service that relieves UBC students with the problem of manually checking the status of a course when it is full. With Project Notify, students are able to receive real-time status updates when a course has a vacancy by entering the course that they wish to monitor and providing a phone number. A SMS text message will be sent to each respective student once a slot opens up for the course they requested.
